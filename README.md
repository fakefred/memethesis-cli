## Updates in 3.0.0-beta

Automation has reached a new level where **all** existing formats are fully
automated by memethesizers for their respective compositions,
including `single`, `vertical`, and `horizontal`.
Adding new formats are now easier than ever,
which is why this repo is open to issues and PR's for new formats,
instead of the author writing new scripts for each one of them because
everyone has limited energy.
If you would like a new format and could afford the time and effort to provide
the data, please open a PR;
if you cannot, open an issue.
The former type of contributors should pay attention to such issues,
and help with them when possible.

## Guide for new formats

Just stuff in metadata into `memethesis/meme/formats.yml` and images into
`memethesis/meme/res/template/[template_name]/[image_name]`.
Here are a few points to follow:

- Make the directory and files distinguishable from others or potential ones:
  for example, `spiderman` serves as a poor identifier for meme formats because there
  are countless spiderman memes.
- Keep the image resolution moderately high. 800px wide is enough.
  Don't scale up too much.
- Use underscores(`_`).
- Use lower case as default, unless capital ones are necessary.
- Update aforementioned `formats.yml` with reference to existing formats if possible.
  When in doubt, consult people who have submitted new formats in the yml.
- Test before opening a PR. Ensure the textboxes are right by feeding it long
  strings like `'mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm'`.
